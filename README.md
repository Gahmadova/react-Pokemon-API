React-Pokemon-Api
I will use react framework on my 2nd project using a PokeAPI send request and I get a response from PokeAPI.

First i start using useState Hook because it allows to addd state to a functional component.Also it return two array with values.

I use allPokemon,setAllPokem array object so pokemon for current state.

I use the useEffect when the application run it use the useEffect if value is change it insur the useEffect

In my index.css I style all the my elements useing css functionality ex: background-color,display,flex-wrap,align-items,justify-content more...

I make Components file inside that folder i make Pokemon.js file so,components are independent and reusable bits of code. It serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. Components come in two types, Class components and Function components.

In react render is the technique that can redirect a page with the help of function render().Also,I use the function and class components both have some additional features.

I use fatch api on my project so,it provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the protocol, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.

I useEffect, for each method and map array to make functionality workable.
