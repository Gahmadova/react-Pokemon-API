React-Pokemon-Api
I will use react framework on my 2nd project using a PokeAPI send request and I get a response from PokeAPI.
First i start using useState Hook because it allows to addd state to a functional component.Also it return two array with values.
I use pokemon,setPokem array object so pokemon for current state setPokemon is a method to update tha data.
